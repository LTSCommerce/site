                    I build complex PHP systems that actually work. 
                    I've spent over a decade turning messy legacy codebases into clean, 
                    high-performance systems. No bullshit, just results.

                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started my career at an ecommerce company back when ecommerce was still new. 
                        There weren't any ready-made solutions that could handle what we needed. 
                        So I learned to program out of necessity. We had to build the systems ourselves 
                        to handle our sales volume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What started as necessity became a passion. I actually enjoyed the development work. 
                        So I decided to really learn it properly. After getting solid with the fundamentals 
                        and building up experience, I went freelance. That was a long time ago now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've put in thousands of hours of hands-on development work. 
                        I can confidently say I'm at expert level now. Writing <strong>"The Art of Modern PHP 8"</strong> 
                        helped solidify that. The best way to learn is to teach, they say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I help businesses with large-scale PHP applications that handle serious volume. 
                        I clean up legacy codebases, tackle massive tech debt, and work in high-pressure environments 
                        where performance and reliability can't fail.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I write clean, maintainable code that lasts. 
                        Every solution should be scalable, secure, and simple to understand. Technology 
                        should serve the business, not complicate it.
                    </p>
