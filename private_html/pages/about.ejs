                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started my career working in an ecommerce business back when ecommerce was still in its infancy. 
                        In those early days, there simply weren't off-the-shelf solutions that could handle the scale and 
                        complexity we needed. I basically had to learn to program in order to create the vital business 
                        systems that would allow us to cope with our sales volume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What began as necessity turned into passion. I discovered that I actually quite liked development, 
                        so I made the decision to focus on really learning it properly. After mastering the fundamentals 
                        and gaining substantial experience, I went freelance. That was a long time ago now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've definitely paid my dues in terms of thousands of hours of hands-on development work. 
                        I can confidently say I'm at expert level now. Writing <strong>"The Art of Modern PHP 8"</strong> 
                        was my way of ensuring that was the caseâ€”the best way to learn is to teach, they say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I help businesses with large-scale, high-turnover, high-complexity PHP applications. 
                        I wrangle legacy PHP codebases, manage massive tech debt, and work in high-pressure environments 
                        where performance and reliability are critical.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time. 
                        Every solution should be scalable, secure, and simple to understand. Technology 
                        should serve the business, not complicate it.
                    </p>
