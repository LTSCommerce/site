## Planning Workflows

This project uses structured planning for complex features. See [@CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md](CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md) for detailed workflow instructions.

All plans are stored in `CLAUDE/plan/` and must follow the standardized format.

### Quick Start

1. **Planning Mode** (default): Research and create plan in `CLAUDE/plan/feature-name.md`
2. **Execution Mode**: Explicitly trigger with "execute plan" or "proceed with implementation"
3. **Status Tracking**: Update progress markers `[ ]`, `[⏳]`, `[✓]` as you work
