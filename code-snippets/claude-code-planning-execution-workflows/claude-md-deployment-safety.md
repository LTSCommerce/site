## Planning Workflows

This project uses structured planning with strict deployment controls.

### Deployment Safety Rules

- Claude must NEVER execute deployment commands
- ALL deployment commands must be run by humans only
- Plans MUST conclude with exact deployment instructions section
- Commands must be researched and tested for accuracy

See [@CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md](CLAUDE/PlanWorkflow.md) for complete workflow documentation.
