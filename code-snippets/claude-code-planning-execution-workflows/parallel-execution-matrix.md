### Parallel Execution Matrix

Include a visual matrix showing agent execution flow:

```markdown
## Parallel Execution Matrix

| Phase | Agent A | Agent B | Agent C | Agent D | Agent E |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1** | Types   | Config  | BLOCKED | BLOCKED | BLOCKED |
| **2** | ✅ Done | ✅ Done | Work    | Work    | Work    |
| **3** | -       | -       | ✅ Done | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |
```

## Critical Dependencies

### Hard Blocks (Must Complete)
1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Foundation required by all components
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: All components needed for integration

### Soft Dependencies (Can Overlap)
- Agent X can start scaffolding while Y completes
- Agent Z can prepare test data during integration
