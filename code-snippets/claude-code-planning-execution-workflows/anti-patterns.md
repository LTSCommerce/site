## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Hidden Dependencies**: Agent D secretly needs output from Agent C
2. **Overly Sequential**: Making phases blocking when they could run in parallel
3. **Missing Interfaces**: Starting parallel work without clear contracts
4. **Vague Deliverables**: "Implement feature" instead of specific file outputs
5. **No Status Tracking**: Parallel agents with no progress visibility
