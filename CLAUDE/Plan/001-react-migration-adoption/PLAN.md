### Next Phase:

**Phase 6: Article System Migration** - Migrate 25+ articles from legacy with content and syntax highlighting

## Overview

Migrate the LTS Commerce static site from EJS/Vite architecture to React/TypeScript, adopting the PlanWorkflow system and development practices that enable efficient AI-assisted development.

This is not just a technology migration—it's adopting a structured approach to development:
- **PlanWorkflow system** for trackable, multi-phase development
- **Worktree workflows** for parallel development when needed
- **Type-safe React/TypeScript** for better code quality and AI assistance

The current LTS site is a PHP engineer's portfolio using EJS templates. We're migrating to React/TypeScript for better type safety, component reusability, and more effective AI collaboration.

## Goals

1. **Adopt PlanWorkflow System**: All future work follows documented plans with phase tracking
2. **Migrate to React/TypeScript**: Convert EJS templates to type-safe React components
3. **Maintain Content Quality**: Preserve all existing PHP-focused articles and content
4. **Type-Safe Architecture**: Leverage TypeScript for better DX and fewer runtime errors
5. **Component-Driven Design**: Adopt reusable, tested component library approach

## Non-Goals

- **Not changing brand focus**: Still PHP engineer portfolio
- **Not discarding existing content**: All current articles and pages preserved
- **Not rushing to production**: Thorough testing before deployment
- **Not copying business strategy**: Tech migration only

## Context & Background

### Current State (LTS Commerce Site)

**Technology Stack:**
- Build: Vite 5.x with custom EJS preprocessing
- Templating: EJS (server-side templates)
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3
- Content: Article system with syntax highlighting
- Deployment: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages

**Limitations:**
- No type safety (vanilla JS)
- Template duplication across articles
- Limited component reusability
- Manual workflow management

### Target State

**Technology Stack:**
- Build: Vite with React/TypeScript
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript 5
- Routing: Type-safe route system
- Components: Reusable component library
- Quality: ESLint + Prettier
- Testing: Playwright smoke tests

**Development Infrastructure:**
- **PlanWorkflow system** for structured development
- **Worktree support** for parallel development
- **Type-safe architecture** throughout

### Skeleton Approach (Plan 002)

**Strategy**: Use `react-site-skeleton` repository as foundation
- **Plan 002** builds the generic skeleton concurrently
- Skeleton provides: Type-safe routing, ESLint rules, minimal components, Claude infrastructure
- **This plan** applies skeleton and builds LTS-specific components/content
- **Archive legacy**: Current build system moved to ARCHIVE/ for reference

**Benefits**:
- Proven patterns from skeleton
- Avoid copying ec-site design
- LTS site gets bespoke components
- Skeleton reusable for future projects

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**:
  - EC-site repository (cloned for reference)
  - Plan 002 (react-site-skeleton) - Phase 2+ blocked until skeleton Phase 4 complete
- **Blocks**: Future content updates
- **Related**:
  - Plan 002 (react-site-skeleton) - concurrent development
  - All future LTS Commerce development

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: React vs Other Frameworks
**Context**: Which modern framework to adopt?

**Options Considered**:
1. React - Industry standard, extensive ecosystem
2. Vue - Simpler learning curve
3. Svelte - Smaller bundles
4. Stay vanilla - No framework overhead

**Decision**: React + TypeScript
- Industry standard
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Rich ecosystem
- Better AI assistant collaboration

**Date**: 2025-12-11

### Decision 2: Article Content Format
**Context**: How to store and render article content?

**Options Considered**:
1. **MDX** - Markdown with React components
2. **HTML rendering** - Keep EJS, use dangerouslySetInnerHTML
3. **Pure React** - Full type safety, verbose for content

**Decision**: TBD - Will evaluate during Phase 6

**Date**: 2025-12-11 (pending)

### Decision 3: Styling Approach
**Context**: CSS Modules, Tailwind, or CSS-in-JS?

**Options Considered**:
1. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first, rapid development
2. **CSS Modules** - Scoped styles, standard CSS
3. **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS, full JS power

**Decision**: TBD - Will evaluate during Phase 7

**Date**: 2025-12-11 (pending)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All current pages accessible in React version
- [ ] All existing articles migrated and rendering correctly
- [ ] TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- [ ] ESLint passing with zero violations
- [ ] Playwright smoke tests passing
- [ ] Lighthouse scores equal or better than current
- [ ] PlanWorkflow system operational for future work
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained or improved

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Article rendering breaks | High | Medium | Test each article, have HTML fallback |
| Bundle size too large | Medium | Medium | Code splitting, monitor sizes |
| TypeScript complexity | Medium | Low | Gradual adoption, allow 'any' in transition |
| Styling inconsistencies | Medium | Medium | Visual regression testing |
| SEO regression | High | Low | Preserve meta tags, test with Lighthouse |

- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (Build System Migration)
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Complete (Type-Safe Routing System)
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Complete (Component Structure Setup)
- **Phase 5**: ✅ Complete (Convert Core Templates - all pages with filtering/search)
- **Phase 6**: 🔜 Next (Article System Migration with content & syntax highlighting)
- **Phases 7-10**: Pending

**Target Completion**: When all phases complete and success criteria met

## Notes & Updates

### 2025-12-11 - Plan Creation (Take 2)
- Started fresh after realizing we copied too much from ec-site (all 70+ plans)
- Taking surgical approach: copy only essential documentation
- Created empty Plan/ directory structure
- Copied: PlanWorkflow.md, Worktree.md, HooksFrontController.md
- This is Plan 001 (clean start for LTS Commerce)
- Phase 1 in progress: Foundation & Documentation

### 2025-12-11 - Infrastructure Approach
**What we copied:**
- Essential documentation only (PlanWorkflow, Worktree, Hooks docs)
- Empty Plan/ directory structure
- Plan numbering instructions

**What we did NOT copy:**
- All 70+ plans from ec-site (not relevant)
- Hooks implementation (can add incrementally if needed)
- All agents/skills (can add as needed)
- EC-site specific content

**Philosophy**: Start minimal, add infrastructure as needed rather than copying everything upfront.

### 2026-01-22 - Phase 5 Audit & Status Update
**Context**: Session became unworkable, used Explore agent to audit status

**Audit Findings**:
- Phase 5 is 95% complete - far more progress than plan indicated
- All 6 major page conversions implemented (Home, About, Contact, ArticleList, ArticleDetail, Layout)
- 25 sample articles with full metadata created in `src/data/articles.ts`
- Type-safe routing, components, and data layer fully operational
- TypeScript: 0 errors, ESLint: 0 violations, Build: successful

**Gaps Identified**:
1. ArticleList missing category filter buttons (legacy has this)
2. ArticleList missing search functionality (legacy has this)
3. ArticleDetail has placeholder for content (Phase 6 work)
4. No syntax highlighting integration yet (Phase 6 work)

**Plan Updated**:
- Marked Phase 5 tasks as complete/in-progress based on reality
- Updated status summary to reflect 95% completion
- Identified clear path forward: finish filters/search, then Phase 6

**Decision**: Focus on completing Phase 5 filtering/search before moving to Phase 6

### 2026-01-22 - Phase 5 Complete
**Implementation**: Added filtering and search to ArticleList page

**Features Added**:
- Category filter buttons (All Categories + 5 category buttons)
- Active state styling for selected filter
- Search input field (filters by title/description, case-insensitive)
- Combined filtering logic (category AND search)
- Dynamic article count with "found" indicator when filtering
- Empty state with helpful message when no results
- useMemo optimization for filtered article computation

**Testing**:
- TypeScript: ✅ 0 errors
- Build: ✅ Successful (1.77s, 218KB bundle)
- Bundle size increase: +1.75KB (filtering logic overhead - acceptable)

**Phase 5 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All core templates converted to React with full functionality article migration
