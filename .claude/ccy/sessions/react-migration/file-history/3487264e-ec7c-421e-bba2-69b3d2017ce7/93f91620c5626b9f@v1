# Claude Code Hooks

This skeleton includes minimal hook infrastructure. Sites can add more hooks as needed.

## What Are Hooks?

Hooks are scripts that run at specific points in Claude Code's workflow:
- **pre-tool-use**: Before a tool executes
- **post-tool-use**: After a tool executes
- **session-start**: When Claude Code starts
- **session-end**: When Claude Code ends

## Skeleton Hooks

The skeleton intentionally keeps hooks minimal. See ec-site for advanced hook examples.

Sites typically add:
- British English enforcement
- Prevent destructive git operations
- Project-specific validation

## How to Add Hooks

1. Create hook file in `.claude/hooks/` (e.g., `pre-tool-use`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use`
3. Return JSON with decision: `allow`, `deny`, or `ask`

See Claude Code documentation for full hook API.
